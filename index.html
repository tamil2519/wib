                    Toxigenic <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> is the etiological agent of cholera .an acute dehydrating diarrhea
                    that
                    occurs in epidemic form in many developing countries. Although V. cholerae is a human pathogen,
                    aquat-
                    ic ecosystems are major habitats of Vibrio species, which includes both pathogenic and nonpathogenic
                    strains
                    that vary in their virulence gene content.<i> V. cholerae</i> belonging to the O1 and O139
                    serogroups is commonly
                    known to carry a set of virulence genes necessary for pathogenesis in humans. Recent studies have
                    indicated
                    that virulence genes or their homologues are also dispersed among environmental strains of V.
                    cholerae
                    belonging to diverse serogroups, which appear to constitute an environmental reservoir of virulence
                    genes. Although the definitive roles of the virulence-associated factors in the environment, and the
                    envi-
                    ronmental selection pressures for V. cholerae-carrying virulence genes or their homologues is not
                    clear, the
                    potential for origination of new epidemic strains from environmental progenitors seems real. It is
                    likely that
                    the aquatic environment harbors different virulence-associated genes scattered among environmental
                    vibrios, which possess a lower virulence potential than the epidemic strains. The ecosystem
                    comprising the
                    aquatic environment, V. cholerae, genetic elements mediating gene transfer, and the mammalian host
